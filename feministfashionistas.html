       <h2>VICTORIA BECKHAM</h2>
     <p>
      She may have entered the cultural lexicon back in the 1990s—first as a member of the bubblegum-pop phenomenon the Spice Girls, then as the wife of the lady-killing soccer player David Beckham—but Victoria Beckham only truly earned her nickname when she took to the London catwalk for designer Maria Grachvogel in February 2000, sporting hot pants and a flamenco dress.

       <h2>ISABEL TOLEDO</h2>
     <p>
       Isabel Toledo’s Midtown studio functions as a visual history of her remarkable life—a sort of creative’s fairy-tale romance that’s inextricably intertwined with her husband, Ruben Toledo, whom she began dating as a teenager. Ruben’s sketches for her clothing line cover the walls. Tiles encircling the staircase and adorning the powder room, painted by Ruben, are called The Isabel Collection.
