  <h3>Our story</h3>

  <p id="introtext">We've created this website as part of the Code First: Girls programme where we are learning skills such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We are feminists who realise that there's <em>still</em> so much to learn, and out of this has come the name <em><b>"Baby Feminists"</b></em></p>
